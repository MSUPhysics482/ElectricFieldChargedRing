# Electric Field Charged Ring
*Starter Code for MSU Physics 482 Homework 2 Question N*

The Jupyter notebook will compute the electric field of a charged ring along its central axis. Your job is to modify this code to investigate the profile of the electric field inside a wire. Recall that the excess charge on the surface of the wire generates the electric field that moves charges in the wire. This charge disitrbiution is gradiated (i.e., it slowly changes sign as you move from the anode to cathode).

To do this investigation, you will need to perform two tasks:

1. Compute and display the electric field at several locations inside the loop of the ring (i.e., in the plane of the ring) to observe the distribution of the field when only one ring is present, and
2. Add a number of additional rings (forming a tube or rather a "thick" wire), and recompute the electric field at the same locations.

*Notice for task 2, you will need to add rings on either side of the initial ring with gradiated surface charge (i.e., the charge of each ring will change a little as you move away from the central ring).*
